# Homelab

This repository contains my homelab configuration files, scripts, and some documentation on how to set up and configure the services I use.

## Why Do I Have a Homelab?

I’m a curious person who loves learning new things. A homelab gives me the freedom to experiment with different technologies and services without the fear of breaking anything critical.

I mainly use my homelab for:  
- Hosting observability tools  
- Running Kubernetes experiments  
- Hosting personal projects  

It’s a playground where I can explore, build, and learn at my own pace.
